mupub - A Mutopia Rewrite
=========================

Overview
--------

The publication process, by nature, has an unavoidable manual phase
but there are opportunities for automation after the visual checks are
made. Once the submission is reviewed the assets for the piece can be
build and published to the archive.

The activity of publishing is the primary focus of this project.

  - **Manual Review** of submission, involving a check for legality
    and appropriate formatting into common U.S. and European paper
    sizes.

  - **Building the assets** that will go into the archive. These include,

    - PDF files in A4 and US Letter sizes
    - MIDI
    - An RDF for general cataloging.
    - PostScript files
    - Preview images

  - **Synchronizing with the data server** to move the new assets to
    the data store.

  - **Updating the site's database** to complete the publication
    process.

At the end of this process the new or updated piece will be available
on the web server.
