mupub - A publishing tool for the Mutopia Project

Synopsis
--------
Currently the back-end publication software is a collection of shell
scripts and Java; this project aims to update this set of tools into a
more cohesive and flexible application with more opportunities for
automation.

Development setup
-----------------

This project uses typical Python tools. Once you clone the repository
you will need to create the appropriate virtual environment. A
``Makefile`` is provided for various developer tasks, including the
initial task of installing required packages, ::

   $ make requirements

More information is available in the project documentation.
